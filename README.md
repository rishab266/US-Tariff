# Tariff and Population Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring the relationship between tariff calculations and population data. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, exploration, comparison, visualization, and hypothetical scenario generation to assess potential impacts of tariff changes and population shifts.

## Key Findings

* **Data Inconsistencies:** Discrepancies were found between the two datasets used.
* **Weak Correlations:** Correlations between population and tariff-related variables were generally weak.
* **Population Outliers:** Potential outliers in the population column were identified.
* **Hypothetical Scenario Impacts:** Scenarios suggest potential impacts on trade deficits and exports, but with high uncertainty.

## Usage

1. **Install Libraries:** `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
2. **Open Notebook:** Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or a local environment.
3. **Run Cells:** Execute the notebook cells to perform the analysis.

## Data

The analysis uses two CSV files:

* "Tariff Calculations plus Population.csv"
* "Tariff Calculations.csv"
